<h1> About us </h1>
<p>Cybersecurity is an essential aspect of the digital world. <br>
While younger people with more knowledge of computers and software get the benefit of securing themselves from cyberattacks,<br>
others face fear and higher chances of being scammed. <br>
The general population often encounters cyberattacks. <br>
The younger generation knows how to avoid it and secure their devices whereas the elderly with minimal knowledge of cybersecurity often face problems.<br>
--------<br>
Through this webpage, we try to educate the elderly generation about phishing emails, phishing links, and account management <br>
by giving them real-life examples, quizzes, and suggestions for improvement </p>

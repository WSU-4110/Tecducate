<h1> About us </h1>
<p>Food waste has been a problem for ages. <br>
While many go hungry and even starve to death all around the world,<br>
others throw food away daily. <br>
We as individuals throw away food at home <br>
but restaurants and grocery stores also throw away a ton of food.<br>
--------<br>
Through this platform, we wish reduce atleast some amount of food waste <br>
by connecting individuals with restaurants.  </p>
